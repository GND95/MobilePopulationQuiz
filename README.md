# MobilePopulationQuiz
My first mobile app made with Xamarin for Android inside Visual Studio 2017.

This is a quiz for Android devices that will test your geographical knowledge of the populations for various countries around the world.

Not much explanation needed, this is an intuitive application. You select an answer and if your selection is correct, that selection will be highlighted in green.  If you are incorrect, it will highlight your selected answer in red and the correct answer in green. There is a pool of possible questions and the program will randomly choose a question that you have not yet been asked each time you press the next button.
